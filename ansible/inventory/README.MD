# Ansible Inventory

This directory contains inventory files that define all nodes in the Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster.

The main inventory file (`inventory.yaml`) defines:
- Gateway node
- Kubernetes master nodes
- Kubernetes worker nodes

Each node is configured with its IP address, hostname, MAC address, and role information.
